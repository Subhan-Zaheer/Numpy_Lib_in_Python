There are hundreds of functions in Numpy but few are discussed below.
1. Mathematics : np.sum, np.exp, np.round, arithmatic operators.
2. Array manipulation : np.reshape, np.concatenate, np.stack, np.split
3. Linear Algebra : np.matmul, np.transpose, np.eigvals, np.dot
4. Statistics : np.mean, np.median, np.max, np.std


Logical Operators in Numpy arrays.
 ==
 !=
 >=
 <=
    All these operators will produce a result after applying these operators one by one on each element.
